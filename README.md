# OOD-on-MNIST
Collaborative exploration of OOD detection strategies using LeNet on MNIST. My role: NN architecture, hyperparameter tuning, training pipeline. Partner handled data augmentation. Implemented IRM method (reference: arXiv:1907.02893) and analyzed results. Collected insights from peer groups' innovative approaches during project presentation.

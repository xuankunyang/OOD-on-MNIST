# OOD-on-MNIST
Research on anomaly detection and out-of-distribution detection based on MNIST dataset

- In this project, I explored some solutions to the OOD (out-of-distribution) problem with my partner. For an introduction to the OOD problem, please see this blog: https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40056577/article/details/115668904.
- - In this project, we used the simplest image recognition convolutional neural network LeNet. For the detailed structure, please refer to the LeNet.svg file in the warehouse. The basic data set we used is also very simple, which is the most primitive handwritten digit recognition: MNIST.
- I am mainly responsible for the construction, parameter adjustment, training and deployment of the neural network, and my partner is mainly responsible for the data augmentation part.
- At the same time, we referred to some cutting-edge methods for solving OOD problems, such as IRM, paper address: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02893, for a detailed introduction, please refer to the Zhihu article: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/567666715.
- Moreover, we also referred to the implementation of the IRM algorithm and did some analysis. The implementation of IRM has also been attached to the warehouse.
- Last but not least, in listening to the collective report of the project, we also gained some good ideas for OOD problems given by many other groups. If you are also interested in this issue, welcome to discuss with me!
